# Pewlett Hackard Analysis with SQL

## Overview

### Purpose

Pewlett Hackard is a large company that is at risk of losing many employees in what could be a called a "silver tsunami". It's important for the company to consider who will be filling in those positions as employees leave, particularly mangement positions. After completing an initial analysis on the employees close to retirement, we now have two more goals. First, determine the number of retiring employees per job title. Second, identify employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
